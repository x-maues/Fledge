## üî¨ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract System

The platform consists of two main smart contracts:

1. **CrowdfundingFactory**
   - Creates and manages individual campaign contracts
   - Maintains a registry of all campaigns
   - Handles campaign creation and contribution routing
   - Provides pagination and filtering for campaign discovery

2. **CrowdfundingCampaign**
   - Manages individual campaign logic
   - Integrates with Flare's FTSO (Flare Time Series Oracle) for real-time price feeds
   - Implements price protection mechanism
   - Handles contributions and fund distribution

### FTSO Integration

The platform leverages Flare's FTSO system for reliable price feeds:

```solidity
function getFlrUsdPrice() public returns (uint256 price, int8 decimals, uint64 timestamp) {
    FtsoV2Interface ftsoV2 = ContractRegistry.getFtsoV2();
    return ftsoV2.getFeedById(FLR_USD_ID);
}
```

Key features of the FTSO integration:
- Real-time FLR/USD price updates
- High accuracy through Flare's decentralized oracle network
- Automatic price protection checks
- Transparent price verification

### Price Protection Mechanism

The system implements price protection through:
1. Continuous monitoring of FLR/USD price via FTSO
2. Automatic goal achievement checks based on current price
3. Secure fund distribution only when price conditions are met
4. Transparent campaign finalization process
